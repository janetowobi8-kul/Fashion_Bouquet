A sales analysis on a fashion bouquet dataset 
This project uses Power BI to analyze a fashion retail dataset, concentrating on sales, stock, customer preferences, pricing, discounts, and returns.  Finding important business insights that retailers can use to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize inventory, and improve pricing strategies is the aim.

# Details of the Dataset

 The dataset includes details about:

 Products: size, color, season, brand, and category

 Pricing: starting price, percentage of markdown, and current price

 Sales: total income, purchase date, and stock amount

 Reviews and ratings from customers

 Returns: the reason and status of the return

 # Key Insights
